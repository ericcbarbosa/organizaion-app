# Organizer App
## Now you know what to do!

The Organizer App is a Task menager, where you can keep track of what to do in your day-to-day.

It was made with React as a Study project, using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) provided by Facebook.

Hope you all enjoy.
